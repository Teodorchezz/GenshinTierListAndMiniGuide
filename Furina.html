        <h2><b style="color: white;">Furina</b></h2>
                <div class="main_text"><p>Furina de Fontaine is a playable Hydro character in <i><b>Genshin Impact</b></i> who can alternate between Pneuma and Ousia alignments. 
                    Introduced as the flamboyant and overconfident Hydro Archon, Furina's theatrics are eventually revealed to be a public persona, 
                    which she later discards in favor of living a relatively humbler life as an actress and artistic consultant.</p>
                    <p>Furina is an off-field DPS and Support that utilizes her Skill to do impressive off-field damage and using her 
                        Burst to offer the team sizeable buffs, allowing her to be the centerpiece of a wide variety of team compositions. 
                        Archons share a pattern of being powerful and centralizing, meaning that they are always worth acquiring and will 
                        be relevant and valuable for a long time.</p>
                    <p>Furina does need some help, however, from a strong healing teammate. One of her main traits is draining the team's 
                        HP in order to deal damage and/or apply buffs. In longer fights like Spiral Abyss (save for players who have multiple
                         5-star units with all their constellations), she will eventually drain her team dry. A character with a powerful, 
                         fast, teamwide heal will be essential to keep the Furina engine going.</p>
