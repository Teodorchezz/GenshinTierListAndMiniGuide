                <td> <p>Kazuha is a 5-star Anemo Sword character in Genshin Impact who boasts strong crowd control,
                    team buffs, and Elemental application. These traits solidify Kazuha as one of the strongest supports 
                    in the game. In fact, it's hard to find a team that he doesn't work well in! On top of that, 
                    his playstyle is fun in both Spiral Abyss and overworld exploration.</p>
                    <p>Pros</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Great buffing ability from both his Ascension 4 Passive DMG buff and 4pc Viridescent Venerer RES Shred</li>
                        <li>Off-field Elemental application, both Anemo and absorbed Elements, with his Elemental Burst</li>
                        <li>Strong off-field damage with the ability to trigger dozens of reactions per rotation</li>
                        <li>On-demand grouping through his low-cooldown Elemental Skill</li>
                        <li>Does not need high investment into Talents to deal damage or provide higher-scaling buffs</li>
                        <li>Large AoE on his Elemental Skill and Burst</li>
                        <li>Extremely flexible unit, and a common choice in “meta” teams</li>
                        <li>Has many accessible 4-star weapon options (Iron Sting, Favonius Sword, Sacrificial Sword)</li>
                        <li>Allows you to have two incredibly strong Anemo options if you already have Sucrose or Venti, which is useful for teambuilding in Spiral Abyss</li>
                    </ul>
